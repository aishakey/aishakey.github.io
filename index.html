        <h3>Some facts you should know before visiting:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Say “Hawaii” and people usually think of Oahu, Maui, Kauai, Lanai, Molokai, Niihau, Kahoolawe and Hawaii. In actuality, the state also encompasses the northwestern Hawaiian islands, a group of islets, seamounts and shoals that extends <strong>1,350</strong> miles northwest of the “main” islands. Harboring an amazing diversity of seabirds and marine life, they are collectively known as the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, a World Heritage Site and the largest contiguous fully protected conservation area under the U.S. flag. Papahanaumokuakea covers <strong>582,578</strong> square miles of the Pacific and is bigger than all of America’s national parks combined.</li>
            <li>On February <strong>14, 1779</strong>, Captain James Cook was killed at Kealakekua Bay on Hawaii island in a skirmish with Hawaiians (he is the British sea captain who is credited with discovering the Hawaiian Islands a year earlier). In <strong>1877</strong>, Hawaiian Princess Miriam Likelike deeded a 5,682-square-foot parcel near the spot where Cook fell to England for $1 with the stipulation that it be used “to keep and maintain...a monument in memory of Captain Cook.” Walk up to the 27-foot white obelisk, and you’ll be on British soil.</li>
            <li>English and Hawaiian are the official languages of Hawaii. Prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries in <strong>1820</strong>, Hawaii had no written language; births, deaths, genealogy, battles, stories of powerful chiefs, descriptions of nature’s beauty and more were passed from generation to generation orally via songs, chants and poems. The missionaries developed the written Hawaiian language, which has just 12 letters: the 5 vowels and 7 consonants (h, k, l, m, n, p and w). It also has an ‘okina symbol, represented in written form as the grave accent (`) or a left single quotation mark (‘). Meaning “separation,” it is a glottal stop that’s considered a consonant.</li>
